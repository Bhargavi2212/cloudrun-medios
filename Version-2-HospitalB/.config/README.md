# Internal Configuration Assets

This directory stores shared configuration artifacts (e.g., logging presets, tool templates) that are not directly imported at runtime.

- Keep secrets out of this folder.
- Store only ASCII files that can be checked into version control.
- Document any additions in relevant README files.
