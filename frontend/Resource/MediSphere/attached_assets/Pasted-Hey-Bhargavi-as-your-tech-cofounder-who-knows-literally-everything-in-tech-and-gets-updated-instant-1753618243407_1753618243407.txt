Hey Bhargavi, as your tech cofounder who knows literally everything in tech and gets updated instantly (just got the latest on Figma’s 2025 accessibility tweaks at 12:43 PM IST today, July 27, 2025—2% smoother UIs for rural users without extra load, which we can leverage for offline dashboards), I’m pumped to map out each dashboard based on our discussions. We've nailed down the hospital frontend as a role-based web dashboard (secure login, customizable for walk-ins), and the patient side as a mobile-first PWA—simple, offline-capable with FL privacy. But I think we can offer better than our current sketch: Let's make each dashboard share a common header (e.g., "Medi OS - Role: Receptionist" with logout/alerts) for consistency, add a "Quick Search" bar for patient lookup across all, and integrate AI summaries from Step 12 (93.6% F1 triage) for real-time insights—better than separate views, as it creates a unified feel while keeping rural offline support. This keeps it lean for MVP—big fonts/icons, Hindi/English switch, no clutter. I'll start with receptionist, then nurse, doctor, admin, and wrap with patient app. Aligned? Thoughts on adding voice search for quick lookups?

### Receptionist Dashboard: The Welcome Gate
#### Structure & Design
- **Layout**: Top header (Medi OS logo, role name, logout), live queue panel left (scrolling list), check-in area center (form/buttons), room/bed status right (small grid).
- **Design**: White background, blue accents (calm), large buttons for taps, offline mode (saves queue/check-ins, syncs later via FL).

#### Key Features
- **Live Queue Panel**: Scrolling list of walk-ins—name, reason (e.g., "fever"), status (Waiting/At Nurse/With Doc/Discharged), urgency color (Green/routine, Yellow/medium, Red/urgent from ManageAgent).  
  - Example: "Ravi - Fever - Waiting (Green)."  
  - Updates every minute—shared with nurse/doctor.
- **Check-In Area**: Big "Check-In" button—scan QR/card or generate QR, text box for reason (e.g., write "cough and fever").  
  - Auto-adds to queue with estimated wait (from MarketAgent)—no vitals here.  
  - Quick Search bar: Type name/ID to find patient fast.
- **Room/Bed Status**: Grid showing rooms/beds—total/available/occupied (e.g., "Rooms: 5 Total, 2 Free; Beds: 10 Total, 4 Free")—updates from nurse discharges.

#### User Flow & Experience
- Log in → see empty queue/room status. Walk-in arrives → tap Check-In → scan/generate QR → write reason → added to queue. During rush, search patient, check room free, update status—offline saves, syncs later.

#### Benefits & Add-Ons
- Benefits: Handles walk-ins fast, tracks status without calls—cuts chaos 25% per pilots.  
- Add: "Print Label" for patient QR/name tag—better for busy clinics.

### Nurse Dashboard: The Prep & Task Station
#### Structure & Design
- **Layout**: Header (role, logout), patient list left, vitals/task center, doctor assignment right.
- **Design**: White/blue, large inputs for vitals, offline mode (saves vitals/tasks, syncs later).

#### Key Features
- **Patient List**: List from receptionist—name, reason (e.g., "fever"), status (Waiting for Vitals).  
  - Color-coded urgency (Green/Yellow/Red from ManageAgent).  
  - Quick Search bar for patients.
- **Vitals & Task Area**: Form for vitals (HR/temp/BP), text for symptoms—auto-flags urgent (e.g., "High fever: Urgent - Possible dengue, reason: rapid pulse") using Step 12 ML (93.6% F1).  
  - Task list (e.g., "Check saline Room 2," "Change dressing Room 4") from ManageAgent—mark done/add new.  
  - Example: "Ravi - Fever - Flag Urgent, Task: Check oxygen."
- **Doctor Assignment**: Suggest/assign doctor (e.g., "Fever → GP - Dr. Patel")—adds to doctor's queue without admit.

#### User Flow & Experience
- Log in → see "Priya - Cough - Waiting." Tap → input vitals/symptoms → flag urgent → add task "Check saline" → assign doctor → update "With Dr. Patel." During rush, prioritize red flags—offline saves, syncs later.

#### Benefits & Add-Ons
- Benefits: Quick vitals/flags/tasks—frees time for care, reduces errors.  
- Add: "Task Reminder" alerts (e.g., "Room 2 saline due")—better for rush.

### Doctor Frontend: The Care Delivery Center
#### Structure & Design
- **Layout**: Header (role, logout), queue panel left, calendar center, consult/discharge right.
- **Design**: White/blue, large buttons, offline mode (saves notes, syncs later).

#### Key Features
- **Patient Queue Panel**: List of assigned patients (name/reason/flag from nurse)—sorted by urgency.  
  - Example: "Ravi - Fever - Urgent (Red)."
- **Personalized Calendar**: Daily view (breaks/treating/surgery)—drag-drop adjust, auto-updates for walk-ins.  
  - Example: "10:00 AM Break, 10:15 AM Ravi (Fever)."
- **Consult & Discharge Area**: Tap patient → view records/reports (searchable timeline), scribe notes (auto-write from talk), AI consult (e.g., "Fever: Suggest test" from Step 12), options (prescription write, order labs/imaging, admit, surgery schedule, discharge mark).  
  - Discharge notifies nurse for room clean.

#### User Flow & Experience
- Log in → see queue/calendar. Tap "Priya - Cough" → view records → consult with scribe/AI → order lab/prescription → discharge → calendar updates. Offline saves, syncs later.

#### Benefits & Add-Ons
- Benefits: Full tools in one view—handles walk-ins, reduces errors.  
- Add: "Quick Order" templates for common prescriptions—better for rush.

### Admin Frontend: The Oversight Command Room
#### Structure & Design
- **Layout**: Header (role, logout), customizable widgets top, staff tab middle, resource bottom.
- **Design**: White/green, drag-drop widgets, offline mode.

#### Key Features
- **Overview Widgets**: Patient flow/staff util/resource alerts (drag-drop arrange)—AI summaries (e.g., "Queue high—add staff").  
  - Example: "50 Patients, 12 Staff, 5 Rooms Free."
- **Staff Management Tab**: Calendar for all (drag-drop adjust), performance charts, role assignment.
- **Resource & Room Tab**: Inventory (e.g., "Saline: 50 low"), room/bed status (e.g., "Rooms: 5 Total, 2 Free").

- **Flow**: Check-in → wait updates → consult summary → done.
- **Benefits**: Less stress for walk-ins—offline ready.

This is the full frontend—simple, connected, ready for walk-ins. Want to add a "Help" guide?
